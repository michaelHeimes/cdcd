						<h2>Our Brand</h2>
						<p>We believe in a connection between music and design. Building a design collaboration with us should feel like the pulse of energy one gets the first time they hear a song and instantly know it will become one of their favorite songs, for a lifetime. The irreverent voice of CDCD gives people hope that their room, their home, their life, might be a little more beautiful or fun if they created an heirloom badass chair such as this. Together with Carla, they can imagine the room they would design around it; the conversations and relationships they could nurture there, the holiday parties they would host in that room and the life that would follow. Like dressing for the life one desires, purchasing a Carla DiOrio Collaborative Design piece offers a glimpse of an elevated version of yourself.</p>

						<ul class="how-it-works">
							<li><b>Step 1:</b> Provide your own antique or vintage chair, Rocker, Sofa or settee frame. If you don’t already have a piece for reupholstery, Carla will source one for you, for an additional fee.</li>
							<li><b>Step 2:</b> Collab with CDCD in deciding which fabric or textile images your heart snd home happiest. Price will be determined and shared before committing to the project. You will pay a standard cost  for labor and design services, and fabric price varies based on textiles chosen.</li>
							<li><b>Step 3:</b> Our team will reupholster the piece.</li>
							<li><b>Step 4:</b> Take home a beautiful piece of responsibly-sourced furniture you can love for years to come.</li>
						</ul>
						<small>Note: we are located just outside of Philadelphia and work predominantly with customers in this region. However, if you would like to work with Carla and can arrange shipping, we are happy to do that.
