						<h2>Our Brand</h2>
						<p>We believe in a connection between music and design. Building a design collaboration with us should feel like the pulse of energy one gets the first time they hear a song and instantly know it will become one of their favorite songs, for a lifetime. The irreverent voice of CDCD gives people hope that their room, their home, their life, might be a little more beautiful or fun if they created an heirloom badass chair such as this. Together with Carla, they can imagine the room they would design around it; the conversations and relationships they could nurture there, the holiday parties they would host in that room and the life that would follow. Like dressing for the life one desires, purchasing a Carla DiOrio Collaborative Design piece offers a glimpse of an elevated version of yourself.</p>
